# My custom dwm build
Custom dwm build for my Linux install. I've decided to try out dynamic window manager and I will document my progress here.

# Patches that I have applied
* [Alpha](../main/patches/dwm-alpha-20201019-61bb8b2.diff) - for transparency;
* [Fullgaps](../main/patches/dwm-fullgaps-20200508-7b77734.diff) - for gaps between windows.

# Keybindings
In this section I will present custom keybindings that I made for my build of _dynamic window manager_.

|		 Keybind		|				Function			|
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
|	Fn + Down arrow		|	Lower volume					|
|	Fn + Up arrow		|	Raise volume					|
|	Fn + Left arrow		|	Lower brightness				|
|	Fn + Right arrow	|	Raise brightness				|
|	PrintScreen			|	Take screenshot					|
|	Shift + PrintScreen |	Copy screenshot to clipboard	|
|	Mod + PrintScreen	|	Paste screenshot from clipboard	|
|	Mod + Pause			|	Lock screen						|
|	Mod + n				|	Switch to ***Nvidia*** GPU'		|
|	Mod + i				|	Switch to ***Intel*** GPU'		|
|	Mod + z				|	Extend displays					|

' - I use ***[optimus-manager](https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager)*** for switching between GPU's.
