# My custom dwm build
Custom dwm build for my Linux install. I've decided to try out dynamic window manager and I will document my progress here.

# Patches that I have applied
* [Alpha](../main/patches/dwm-alpha-20201019-61bb8b2.diff) - for transparency;
* [Fullgaps](../main/patches/dwm-fullgaps-20200508-7b77734.diff) - for gaps between windows.

# Keybindings
In this section I will present keybindings that I use in my window manager.
